Submission for the Mubaloo Appathon 2014

This is an app that allows you to scan products in UK supermarkets, view ratings and rate them yourself.

The motivation: Ever walked into a supermarket at lunch-time and thought "Oh I wonder if this sandwich is nice ?"
Well now you can check its rating and rate it to help others.
